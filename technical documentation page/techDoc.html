                <p>The First step to building a pc is to know the reason why you
                    want the PC. Do you want to build it for gaming,
                    streaming or work related stuff.</p>
                <p>Ater you have figured out what what you need the PC for make
                    sure you have bought all the parts required to
                    buils an PC.</p>

                <li>A head screwdriver(Have many different sizes)</li>
                <li>A clean surface(so you would not lose something small)</li>
                <p>Those are all the tools you need to build a PC</p>

                <header class="header">Strip down the case</header>
                <p>Strip down all the panels, nails and other comparments which
                    can be taken off.</p>
                <p>Make sure to keep all the nails and compartments in a safe

                <p>If you’ve purchased cooling fans, now is the time to install
                    them. Try to keep your cooling setup balanced, so
                    there’s as much air being drawn in, as is being blown out.</p>
                <p>The typical PC setup is two fans in the front and one fan in
                    the back so the PC can stay cool.</p>
                <li>Water cooling is a type of cooling also but we will not be
                    going over that in this guide</li>

                <p>Carefully line up the ports and do not apply to much pressure

                <p>For Intel mainstream CPUs, slide the spring loaded retention
                    arm out and up, then lift the bracket up leaving the plastic
                    cover in place. Then, gently place your CPU inside the
                    socket, matching the golden triangle located on the bottom
                    left corner of the processor, with the triangle on the
                    socket bracket. </p>
                <p>slide the securing bracket back into its original position so
                    it locks in place underneath the screw, and secure the
                    retention arm back down.</p>

                    of the DDR4 slots on your motherboard. Then line up the
                    notch on the bottom of the memory with the notch in the
                    slot. After that, you can install the memory by carefully
                    pushing down both sides of the memory into the slot. You
                    should hear a clicking sound as the memory secures into
                    place and the latches click back up. </p>

                <p>If your PC case comes with a PSU bracket, remove it ahead of
                    time and attach it to the back of the unit. Next up thread
                    the cables through the PSU slot in the back of the case
                    first, and then slide the PSU into place, securing the

                <header class="header">Connect Everything to The Motherboard</header>
                <p>To get your front I/O power buttons working properly, you
                    need to plug in the correct cables. This is a single block
                    that plugs directly onto the front I/O headers on the
                    motherboard, make sure you orient it the correct way, then
                    push it into place on the pins. </p>
                <p>For everything else, take the individual pins, and, using the
                    motherboard installation handbook, identify which pins and
                    cables need connecting. </p>
                <p>It’s also a good time to plug in your USB 3.0 header, USB 2.0
                    header, and audio passthrough. Audio is located on the
                    bottom left of most motherboards. It will be labelled, and
                    the pin outs will be different to the USB 2.0 headers.
                    Install your USB 3.0 cables into any available slots on the
                    board, making sure to lineup the pins with the holes in the
                    USB 3.0 cables.</p>
                <p>This is for the power supply, ientify your 8-pin EPS cable,
                    and slide it up the back of
                    the chassis, through the cable grommet and plug it into the
                    8 pin power slot at the top of the motherboard. Then, find
                    the bulkier 24-pin cable, slide that through any cable
                    routing recesses on the chassis and plug it into the
                    corresponding 24-pin ATX power port on the motherboard. </p>

                <header class="header">Install Your Graphics card</header>
                <p>First take a look at your motherboard and locate the PCIe
                    slot closest to your processor. From there locate the two
                    PCIe slots next to where you’ll want to install your GPU and
                    remove them. In most PC cases, that’ll involve undoing two
                    screws on the PCIe slot covers and removing them. </p>
                <p>Take your graphics card out of the anti-static bag and line
                    it up with the slots we just opened up. The rear I/O on the
                    GPU should be facing out the back of the chassis. Once the
                    gold contacts on your GPU make are touching the PCIe slot,
                    gently push it into place until you hear a click. Then use
                    the same screws we removed from the PCIe slot cover to
                    secure the GPU into place.</p>
